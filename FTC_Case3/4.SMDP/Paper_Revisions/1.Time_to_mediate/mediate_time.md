# Time to mediate a fault

Fault magnitudes to be explored:

For the distillate, optimal value is 15.7

Magnitudes will be: 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8
Thus, stuck valve positions are: **15.2, 14.7, 13.7, 11.7, 7.7**

Time calculation = Time from first action to 98% of the original desired set point.

## Fault: 15.2 - Steps required: 1 (1)
24 time step

## Fault: 14.7 - Steps required: 1 (5)
39 or 60 time step

## Fault: 13.7 - Steps required: 2 (11)
39 or 46 time step

## Fault: 11.7 - Steps required: 3 (25)
68, 87

## Fault: 7.7 - Steps required: 5 (50)
110,115,127
